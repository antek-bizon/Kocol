                <p>Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle...and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to kill him.</p>

                <h2>Commander's speech</h2>
                <p> We've confirmed that the network core units known as Adam and Eve have been destroyed. The enemy's chain of command has been thrown into complete chaos. As such, humanity has chosen to seize this opportunity and launch an all-out attack against the machine forces. Of course, the forces of YoRHa will participate in this endeavor. Remember your pain, the pain of having your homeland stolen! We will never give up our struggle. We will take back the seas! The skies! The land! We will take back our world from the scourge of the machines! We will not fail an mission... Here and now, we will put an end to it goddamn war! Glory to mankind!
